<-README: This file should be in the config/generatormods folder->

<-GlobalFrequency controls how likely structures are to appear. Should be between 0.0 and 1.0. Lower to make less common->
GlobalFrequency:0
<-TriesPerChunk allows multiple attempts per chunk. Only change from 1 if you want very dense generation!->
TriesPerChunk:0
<-AllowedDimensions allows structures in corresponding dimension, by dimension ID. Default is Nether(-1) and OverWorld(0)->
AllowedDimensions:-1,0,1
<-LogActivated controls information stored into forge logs. Set to true if you want to report an issue with complete forge logs.->
LogActivated:false

<-MinHeight and MaxHeight are the minimum and maximum allowed height of the structures->
<-MinHeightBeforeOscillation - Any structures that form oscillators before MaxOscillatorCullStep will be culled.->
<-Smooth with stairs - If set to true, will smooth out ruins by placing extra stair blocks.->
<-ContainerWidth and ContainerLength are the dimensions of the bounding rectangle.->
MinHeight:20
MaxHeight:70
MinHeightBeforeOscillation:12
SmoothWithStairs:true
MakeFloors:true
ContainerWidth:40
ContainerLength:40


<-Chest contents->
<-Tries is the number of selections that will be made for this chest type.->
<-Format for items is <item name-damage value>,<selection weight>,<min stack size>,<max stack size>,<json> ->
<-Where <damage value> and <json> are optional. Json format follows same rules as /give command->
<-So e.g. minecraft:arrow,2,1,12 means a stack of between 1 and 12 arrows, with a selection weight of 2.->

<-An automata rule should be in the form B<neighbor digits>/S<neighbor digits>, where B stands for "birth" and S stands->
